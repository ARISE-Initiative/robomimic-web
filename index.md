**robomimic** is a framework for robot learning from demonstration. It offers a broad set of demonstration datasets collected on robot manipulation domains, and learning algorithms to learn from these datasets. This project is part of the broader [Advancing Robot Intelligence through Simulated Environments (ARISE) Initiative](https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative), with the aim of lowering the barriers of entry for cutting-edge research at the intersection of AI and Robotics.
